# Global Layoffs EDA Using MySQL

## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring global layoffs data using **MySQL**. The analysis uncovers insights into how layoffs have impacted different industries, companies, countries, and time periods. The primary objective is to use SQL to answer real-world business questions and identify patterns in workforce reductions.

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle's World Layoff Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/),](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022) which includes information on:
- Company Name
- Total Laid Off
- Percentage Laid Off
- Industry
- Country
- Date
- Company Size
- Stage (e.g., Seed, Series A, Public)

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **MySQL**
- **MySQL Workbench**
- **GitHub**
- **VS Code** (for writing and organizing SQL queries)

## 🔍 Key Business Questions Explored
- 🔹 Which companies recorded the highest number of layoffs?
- 🔹 What industries were most affected globally?
- 🔹 Which countries experienced the most layoffs?
- 🔹 What was the trend of layoffs over the years?
- 🔹 How does the percentage of laid-off employees vary by company size?

## Sample SQL Queries

```sql
-- Top 10 companies with the highest layoffs
SELECT company, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_layoffs
FROM layoffs
GROUP BY company
ORDER BY total_layoffs DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Total layoffs by country
SELECT country, SUM(total_laid_off) AS country_layoffs
FROM layoffs
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY country_layoffs DESC;

-- Layoffs trend by year
SELECT YEAR(date) AS year, SUM(total_laid_off) AS yearly_layoffs
FROM layoffs
GROUP BY YEAR(date)
ORDER BY year;
